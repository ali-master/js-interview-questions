The output would be `1undefined`. The if condition statement evaluates using `eval`, so `eval(function f(){})` returns `function f(){}` (which is true). Therefore, inside the if statement, executing `typeof f` returns `undefined` because the if statement code executes at run time, and the statement inside the if condition is evaluated during run time.
