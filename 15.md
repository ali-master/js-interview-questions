The code above will output `undefined` as output. `delete` operator is used to delete a property from an object. Here `x` is an object which has `foo` as a property and from a self-invoking function, we are deleting the `foo` property of object `x` and after deletion, we are trying to reference deleted property `foo` which result `undefined`.
