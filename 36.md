The output would be `Reference Error`. To make the code above work, you can re-write it as follows:

#### Sample 1
```js
var bar = function(){ return 12; };
typeof bar();  
```

#### Sample 2
```js
function bar(){ return 12; };
typeof bar();  
```

A function definition can have only one reference variable as its function name. In **sample 1**, `bar`'s reference variable points to `anonymous function`. In sample 2, the function's definition is the name function.

```js
var foo = function bar(){ 
    // foo is visible here 
    // bar is visible here
 	console.log(typeof bar()); // Work here :)
 };
// foo is visible here
// bar is undefined here
```
