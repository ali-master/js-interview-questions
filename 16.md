### Answer
The code above will output `xyz` as output. Here `emp1` object got company as **prototype** property. delete operator doesn't delete prototype property.

`emp1` object doesn't have **company** as its own property. you can test it `console.log(emp1.hasOwnProperty('company')); //output : false` However, we can delete company property directly from `Employee` object using delete` Employee.company` or we can also delete from `emp1` object using `__proto__` property `delete emp1.__proto__.company`.
