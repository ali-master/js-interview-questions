The output would be `undefined`. According to the `associativity` rule, operators with the same precedence are processed based on the associativity property of the operator. Here, the associativity of the assignment operator is `Right to Left`, so `typeof y` will evaluate first , which is `undefined`. It will be assigned to `z`, and then `y` would be assigned the value of z and then z would be assigned the value `1`.
