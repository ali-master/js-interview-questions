Answer: **C**
`new Number()` is a built-in function constructor. Although it looks like a number, it's not really a number: it has a bunch of extra features and is an object.

When we use the `==` operator, it only checks whether it has the same value. They both have the value of `3`, so it returns `true`.

However, when we use the `===` operator, both value and type should be the same. It's not: `new Number()` is not a number, it's an object. Both return `false`.
